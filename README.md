A modern solitaire game based on [Matrix Overload](https://notwriting.itch.io/matrix-overload), which itself was based on [Gridcannon](https://www.pentadact.com/2019-08-20-gridcannon-a-single-player-game-with-regular-playing-cards/).

Made using vanilla/plain JavaScript, vanilla/plain CSS, and vanilla/plain HTML (notice a theme perhaps?). Uses Rollup for bundling the JavaScript (`npm run build` or `npm run watch`).

Only dependency is my [DeckOfCards.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andrewscripts/deck-of-cards.js) library.

You can run locally by just opening the index.html file in your browser, or online [here](https://andrew565.github.io/ProjectMO).

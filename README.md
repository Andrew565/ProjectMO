A modern solitaire game based on Matrix Overload.

Made using vanilla/plain JavaScript, vanilla/plain CSS, and vanilla/plain HTML (notice a theme perhaps?). Uses Rollup for bundling the JavaScript (`npm run build` or `npm run watch`).

Only dependencies are `dragula` and my [DeckOfCards.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andrewscripts/deck-of-cards.js) library.

You can run locally by just opening the index.html file in your browser, or online [here](https://andrew565.github.io/ProjectMO).

# KNOWN TODOS AND FIXMES

Roughly in order of priority.

- [ ] Add a second joker (oops!)
- [ ] Make "11's" placeable anywhere in outer piles (pay attention to jokers)
- [ ] Update instructions to reflect "Firewalls" instead of Royals
- [ ] Fix the "No valid placements" lose condition (investigate what the problem is, forgot to write it down)
- [ ] Add an indicator for when defeat conditions are met
- [ ] Create an "easy mode" that ignores the same suit and same color rules?
- [ ] Add "tap to peek" somehow so that people can see what cards are in each inner pile?
- [ ] Add graphics to the rules?
- [ ] Add a more "interactive" tutorial
- [ ] Add local statistics (be sure to include a reset button, attempts, wins, and losses)
- [ ] Make the game keyboard accessible
- [ ] Add "Cybermancy" rules? (BIG PROJECT)

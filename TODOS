# KNOWN TODOS AND FIXMES

Roughly in order of priority.

- TODO: Better card back to make face-down cards more obvious
- TODO: Improve the "You Lost!" message to make it more clear "why" the player lost (no more room for armor or ran out of cards)
- TODO: Add "tap to peek" somehow so that people can see what cards are in each inner pile
- TODO: Create an "easy mode" that ignores the same suit and same color rules?
- TODO: Add a more "interactive" tutorial
- TODO: Add local statistics (be sure to include a reset button, attempts, wins, and losses)
